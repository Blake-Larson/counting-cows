# Counting Cows
In June of 2022 my wife and I moved across the country. She liked playing a road trip game called Counting Cows. I decided to make a web app to help us keep score during our game.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Heroku

I developed this app from scratch using the above tech. I also used [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/use/) which has some pre-built components that work well with TailwindCSS. I had a fun time putting together the simple game mechanics in Express. 


## Optimizations
I have temporarily disabled the functionality of the site while I look into options for authentication. I aim to provide a way for users to create their own games where they can view and interact with thier party's scores.

## Lessons Learned:
From this project I became much more familiar with using the older style of callbacks in Express and how I can communicate with MongoDB. I also learned more about EJS and how to easily display data from MongoDB.


## Other Work:
Take a look at an example of work I did for a client.
